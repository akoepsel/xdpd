Brief:
	This is a white canvas for writing the port to your own platform in xDPD. The forwarding module does nothing but print traces.
	You may want to have a look to ROFL-pipeline library in order to build the internals of the library.

Folder structure and some files:
	- afa-imp: Abstract Forwarding API implementation (forwarding module end)
