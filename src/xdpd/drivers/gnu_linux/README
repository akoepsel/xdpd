The GNU/Linux (user-space) driver 

## Brief:

The content of this folder is the implementation of the generic GNU/Linux OS (HAL-compliant) driver in user-space. 

Please have a look to ROFL-HAL for more details about the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) 

## Comments:
This driver makes extensive use of the ROFL-pipeline library. 

For more information about the architecture of this driver, please have on the xDPD wiki.

The driver can be extended in a number of ways, particularly:

	- New ports (io/ports/ioport.h), like Netmap, PQF... Derive your class from ioport and you are ready to go
	- Better scheduling polices (io/scheduler/ioscheduler.h). Derive your class from ioscheduler.h
	- New and more efficient network protocol header parsers (io/packet_classifiers/packetclassifier.h). Derive your class from packetclassifier.h.
	- New network protocol support (OF matches) and new actions (OF actions). This may imply extension/modification of other parts of xDPD including ROFL-core (endpoint) libraries, ROFL-pipeline (core platform-agnostic Openflow pipeline) and packet classifiers. Extension in ROFL-core and ROFL-pipeline will also benefit other platforms; they are shared among all the drivers.
	- New Openflow software lookup algorithms (matching algorithms). This implies only extension on ROFL-pipeline library. All software packet processing drivers will benefit from these extensions.
