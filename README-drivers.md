Note that drivers may, or may not, make use of xdpd's `-e` option to receive additional parameters during initialization.

Compile driver support
======================

To compile support for a driver:

	sh# ../configure --with-hw-support="<driver-code-name>" 
	sh# make  
	sh# make install

Default is:

	sh# ../configure --with-hw-support="gnu-linux"
