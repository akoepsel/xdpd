What it is
==========

"The OpenFlow eXtensible DataPath daemon (xDPd) is a multi-platform, multi OF version, open-source datapath built focusing on performance and extensibility."

xDPd can also be considered a framework for building OpenFlow datapath elements, as it is designed to be easily extended with the support of new forwarding devices.

Supported platforms
===================

Shipped with all xDPd instances:
- GNU/Linux amd64/x86 user-space with mmap or netmap (gnu-linux). open-source
- GNU/Linux + NetFGPA-10G (netfpga10g). open-source. 

Also available:

- Broadcom Triumph2 (bcm).
- Octeon network processors (octeon5650). 
- GNU/Linux + DPDK (gnu-linux-dpdk).
- Other: refer to the wiki page for more details

You may want to have a look to the particular README pages of each platform by inspecting:

src/xdpd/fwd_modules/{platform_name}/README

Requirements
============

- A modern GNU build-system (autoconf, automake, libtool, ...)
- GNU/Linux and libc development headers (linux-libc-dev and libc6-dev package in Debian/Ubuntu systems)
- pkg-config
- libconfig C++ lib (libconfig++-dev in Debian/Ubuntu systems)
- ROFL libraries installed [1]
- [optional] if you want to run automatic tests (make check), libcunit and libcppunit are required (in libcunit1-dev and libcppunit-dev packages in Debian-like systems).
- [optional] Doxygen to generate the documentation.

How to build
============

Install the dependencies and run:

sh# ./autogen.sh
sh# cd build
sh# ../configure
sh# make
sh# make install

Optionally you can 'make check' for consistency checks.

How to run it
================================

Copy the example.cfg: 

sh# cd build/src/xdpd
sh# cp src/xdpd/management/plugins/config/example.cfg .

Now edit the configuration. Make sure ports attached to the Logical Switch Instance (LSI) exist in the system.

sh# vi src/xdpd/management/plugins/config/example.cfg  

Run xdpd:

sh# ./xdpd -c example.cfg

Optional ../configure parameters
================================

--with-hw-support=platform-name: Compiles support for the platform-name (forwarding module). Default is gnu-linux.
--with-plugins="plugin1...pluginN": Compile with plugin1..pluginN enabled. Default is --with-plugins="config" plugin
--enable-debug: Compile with debug symbols (-g) and debug output (warning, it may affect performance).
--disable-silent-rules: Enable verbose compilation mode (AM_SILENT_RULES disabled)

Doxygen documentation
================================
Documentation can be compiled via 'make doc'. Documentation is generated in build/doc/ folder
